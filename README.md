## Derivative Pricing Coursework

This repository contains coursework, laboratory exercises, and a group project completed as part of my university studies in **quantitative and computational finance**, with a primary focus on the UCD undergrad **Advanced Computational Finance** module (ACM30110).

The work emphasises numerical methods, Monte Carlo simulation, and variance reduction techniques used in modern derivative pricing and financial risk analysis.

## Module Focus: Advanced Computational Finance

The coursework in this repository covers the following topics:

- Pricing of European and American options using Black–Scholes and binomial tree methods  
- Monte Carlo simulation under risk-neutral dynamics  
- Control variates and antithetic variates for variance reduction  
- Pricing of barrier and path-dependent exotic options  
- Estimation of option sensitivities (Greeks) via simulation  
- Portfolio Delta and variance analysis  
- Evaluation of numerical accuracy using standard deviation and correlation measures

## Applied Project Synopsis

The repository includes a group project involving the pricing of a **path-dependent exotic barrier option** specified by performance thresholds monitored throughout the life of the option.  

The project required:
- Simulation of daily stock price paths using geometric Brownian motion  
- Implementation of Monte Carlo pricing methods  
- Application of variance reduction techniques to improve estimator efficiency  
- Clear documentation of code, numerical results, and team collaboration  

Supporting materials include the Python implementation, code documentation, presentation slides, and a project diary outlining roles, meetings, and problem resolution.

## Repository Structure

The repository contains:
- Jupyter notebooks with fully worked laboratory and tutorial exercises  
- Python scripts implementing the group project pricing algorithm  
- Written documentation explaining methodology and results  
- Presentation material prepared for a non-technical audience  

All code prioritises clarity, correctness, and transparency over optimisation.
